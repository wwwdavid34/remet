## Description

**Never forget a face or name again.**

We've all been there—you see someone familiar, but their name escapes you. Remet helps you build lasting memories of the people you meet, so you can greet everyone with confidence.

**How it works:**

1. **Capture** - Snap a photo when you meet someone new. Add their name, where you met, and any details you want to remember.

2. **Practice** - Quick daily quizzes help move faces from short-term to long-term memory. Just a few minutes a day makes a real difference.

3. **Recall** - When you see someone again, Remet helps you instantly remember their name and how you know them.

**Key Features:**

• Quick photo capture with automatic face detection
• Practice quizzes that adapt to your memory strength
• Organize people by tags (Work, Family, Gym, etc.)
• Add notes about how you met and conversation topics
• Track your progress and see your memory improve
• Works completely offline - your data stays on your device

**Perfect for:**

• Professionals who meet many clients or colleagues
• Teachers learning student names
• Anyone who wants to be better with names
• People attending conferences or networking events

**Privacy First:**

All face recognition happens on your device. Your photos and personal information never leave your phone unless you choose to enable iCloud backup.

**Premium Features:**

• Unlimited people and encounters
• iCloud sync across devices
• Unlimited tags for organization

Download Remet today and start building stronger connections with the people in your life.
